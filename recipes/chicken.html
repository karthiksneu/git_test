    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>TThese chai crescent rolls with sausage are made from refrigerated crescent roll dough, warmly spiced with
        earthy, sweet chai latte mix, wrapped around breakfast sausage, and baked until flaky, golden, and hot. They are
        yummy and so quick, so easy.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 links fully-cooked breakfast sausage</li>
        <li>1 (8-ounce) package refrigerated rescent rolls</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chai latte mix, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment.</li>
        <li>Place sausages on a plate, and partially warm in a microwave, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon chai mix on a plate. Separate crescent roll dough into triangles; press each side of
            one crescent roll triangle into chai powder. Place a sausage link at the wide end of the triangle, and roll
            it up. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining crescent rolls and sausages, using additional chai mix as needed.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and sausage is heated through, 10 to 12 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
